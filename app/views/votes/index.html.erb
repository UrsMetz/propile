<p>
  A few weeks before the Program Committee meeting, you can activate the voting system on the <%= link_to 'Configurations', propile_configs_path %> page.
  <br />
  Note: This will speed up presenters to improve their sessions and add more reviews on other sessions.  :-) <br />
  We will use the votes to calculate the PAF of proposed programs during the Program Committee Meeting (see <%= link_to "Programs", programs_path %>).
  <br />
  Send out a mail to all presenters who have submitted a session and ask them to vote. <br />
  <br />
  <%= render :partial=>'rules' %>
  Presenters can see a list of the sessions they have voted for on their own presenter's page (which should have their bio by now ;-). 
  Votes for a session are created and canceled on that session's details page.<br />
  <br />
</p>
<p> 
  If you want to analyze the votes, you can <%= link_to 'export a CSV', csv_votes_path %>.
</p>
<p> 
  Prepare for Program Committee Meeting with the 
  <%= link_to 'Printable sessions for Program Committee Meeting', controller: 'sessions', action: 'pcm_cards', format: "pdf" %>
