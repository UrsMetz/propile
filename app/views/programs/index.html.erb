<%= link_to 'New Program from scratch', new_program_path %> -> an empty program is created with 8 rows and 5 columns.  You can also create a new program as a copy from an existing program. As a start, to come to the best program at the Program Committee Meeting, it is best to just stick with the tracks/slots you want to have in the program. Later you can also dress your program with non-session-rows to include "Registration" and "Lunch", and with a "Times" Column. 
</p>
<p>
<%= link_to 'Public view on Active Program', public_programs_path %> -> gives you a public view on the program that was activated most recently.
