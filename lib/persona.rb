Some of the ideas she learned about seemed interesting enough, but she is not sure if this methodology is applicable in their particular situation. After the course, some of her colleagues started to write unit tests, but there still are only a few, and they are not run very often, as far as Marieke can see. They also started to do a daily standup meeting, because according to the  trainers that is a tool to enhance communication within the team. But these meetings are rather boring, and they tend to take 1/2 hour, every day. Team members are grumbling about wasting their time.\n
Marieke started to think all this agile stuff is only an unusable hype. But then she heard about #{Conference::NAME}, and she thought \"well, let's give it another chance, if 150 people go to this conference, for 11 years in a row now, maybe there is more to it\".
